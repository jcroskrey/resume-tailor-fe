## Resume Tailor - Frontend

This is the github repo for the frontend of my resume tailoring project.

### Inspiration
Over time, as your experience grows, you will inevitably modify your resume. Since resume's are supposed to be only one or two pages, you will likely trim down certain projects or experiences over time to make room for new ones. However, this will result in data loss since you are deleting certain portions of your resume (likely from a Word document). You can solve this by keeping many different versions of your resume, but this gets messy fast (source: trust me bro). 

The idea for this application is to store **ALL** your work experiences, both big and small. When you are ready to apply for a job, you can pick the most relevent ones from this application to fit on a one page downloadable pdf template and use that for the application. This way you will not lose any data by tailoring your resume for that job. Who knows, maybe AI can help with picking your most relevant experiences when supplied with a job description? (foreshadowing intensifies...)
